        <h2>Projects</h2>
            
            <p>i have worked on several 
              projects and my porfolio 
              is demonstrated below.From
              January 2022 to February 2022, I served as an It assistant for the Ardhi Sasa Project, utilizing the
              platform to enhance my strategic communication and customer engagement skills. 
              In parallel roles as Customer Engagement Impact and Calls Reception Officer, I handled diverse
              responsibilities, including outbound calls, field officer linkages, data entry, and query resolution.
              Notably, this experience also led to the development of proficiency in using G Suite applications,
              significantly elevating my overall IT skills. My dedication to gaining G Suite skills during this
              period was marked by a focus on advanced spreadsheet proficiency. I acquired expertise in
              intricate formulas, dynamic presentations, the implementation of key performance indicators and
              more. Engaging in hands-on tasks such data entry for products, and daily performance reporting
              not only elevated my G Suite proficiency but also notably enhanced my analytical and
              organizational skills within the realm of spreadsheet applications.</p>
